# Day 23 Lab Rubric

**Core: 100 points · Bonus: 20 points (additive, not gating)**

Grader runs `make verify` from a clean clone. Exit code 0 = all core checkpoints pass.

## Failing checkpoints

If `make verify` exits non-zero:

1. Check Compose stack health: `make smoke`
2. Check the specific failing line in `verify.py` output
3. Common issues:
   - Grafana not yet provisioned dashboards (wait 30s after first `up`)
   - Slack webhook unset or wrong URL → no fire/resolve evidence
   - Drift script not run yet → no `drift-summary.json`
   - REFLECTION.md too short (< 500 chars) → re-fill

## Grading philosophy

We grade your **report**, not your absolute numbers. P99 latency on M1 vs RTX 4090 is wildly different — what matters is that you measured it, dashboarded it, alerted on it, and can explain what you'd change.
